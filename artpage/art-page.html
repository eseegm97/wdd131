        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>As a fan of art, one of my favorite artists is the surrealist painter, Salvador Dali. I want to create a space that can be a home for Dali's artwork. It will be a place where others can come and learn more about Salvador Dali and his art!</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My audience will primarily be other art appreciators, and perhaps those learning about Dali in an art class or college course who want to learn more.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>Already, I know of a few dynamic elements that I want to add to my site, specifically related to art viewing. First of all, I would like for the home page of my site to contain a small portfolio conveyor near the bottom of the page, which will rotate automatically and contain many different works of Dali's art to catch the viewer's eye. Additionally, I want for there to be a form which visitors to the site can use to ask questions about Dali's art and life. Additionally, it should automatically send a message to me letting me know there is a new message that needs a response. I will use Javascript for both of these.</p>

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <h3>Website Logo</h3>
        <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
        Palette URL:

                </tr>
                <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
                <tr>
                    <td class="primary">[#42858C]</td>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>This page will contain a basic intro to the site, introducing myself and my artwork. I will have a small revolving gallery on the home page, which automatically rotates samples of my art.</p>
        <h3>Gallery</h3>
        <p>This will contain a more comprehensive and detailed gallery, and will be more interactive.</p>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
            here
