            <h3>The History of Salvador Dalí</h3>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Salvador Dalí was born on May 11, 1904, in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain, into a family of middle-class background. His father, a strict lawyer, and his mother, who supported his artistic interests, both played influential roles in his life. Dalí showed an early talent for art, beginning formal training at the age of 10. At 17, he entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, where he developed his unique style and grew increasingly influenced by Impressionism, Cubism, and Freudian theory. Dalí’s childhood was marked by the tragic death of his older brother, also named Salvador, which deeply affected him and became a recurring theme in his work. His early experiences, both personal and artistic, shaped the visionary approach that would define his later surrealist masterpieces.</p>
            <h3>Madrid, Barcelona, and Paris</h3>
            <p>During his time in Madrid, Salvador Dalí expanded his artistic horizons at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, where he became known for his bold, experimental techniques. His rebellious nature led him to challenge traditional methods and embrace modern art movements like Cubism, Impressionism, and Futurism. In Barcelona, Dalí became involved with avant-garde artists and writers, forming connections that would influence his surrealist style. It was here that he met Joan Miró and other key figures of the Catalan art scene. Dalí’s time in Paris, beginning in the late 1920s, marked a pivotal shift in his career. He was introduced to the Surrealist movement led by André Breton and quickly became one of its most prominent members. Inspired by Freud’s theories of the unconscious mind, Dalí’s work took on dreamlike qualities, incorporating bizarre, symbolic imagery. His iconic painting The Persistence of Memory (1931), with its melting clocks, emerged during this period, cementing his reputation as a master of surrealism.</p>
            <h3>1929 to World War II</h3>
            <p>From 1929 to the outbreak of World War II, Salvador Dalí's career reached new heights as he fully immersed himself in the Surrealist movement. In 1929, he began collaborating with the likes of André Breton, Luis Buñuel, and other leading Surrealists, gaining international recognition. During this period, Dalí's work became increasingly eccentric, blending dreamlike, fantastical imagery with deep psychological exploration. His famous film Un Chien Andalou (1929), co-directed with Buñuel, exemplified his exploration of irrationality and subconscious desires. Dalí’s personal life also played a significant role during this time, as he met and fell deeply in love with his muse, Gala Éluard, who would become his wife and the central figure in much of his work. Throughout the 1930s, Dalí's paintings grew more intricate and symbolic, with works like The Great Masturbator (1929) and The Persistence of Memory (1931) showcasing his fascination with time, decay, and the unconscious. His relationship with the Surrealists became strained due to his increasingly eccentric behavior and fascination with mysticism, but his influence continued to grow. As tensions rose across Europe, Dalí relocated to the United States in 1940 to escape the war, marking a new chapter in his career.</p>
            <h3>World War II</h3>
            <p>During World War II, Salvador Dalí's life and work underwent significant transformation. As the war intensified in Europe, Dalí fled to the United States in 1940, leaving behind the chaos of war and the turmoil within the Surrealist movement, where he had become increasingly isolated due to his growing interest in mysticism and his departure from traditional Surrealist ideals. In the U.S., Dalí embraced the fame and fortune that came with his surrealist works, expanding his artistic range to include fashion, advertising, and even theater design. He also ventured into the field of scientific and mathematical exploration, incorporating themes of atomic theory and the concept of nuclear mysticism into his art, as seen in works like The Atomic Leda (1949). Dalí's time in America marked a period of intense commercial success, with numerous exhibitions, including his first major retrospective in New York in 1941. Despite his fame, his work became more detached from the Surrealist group, as he increasingly focused on his personal vision, including a growing obsession with classical forms, religion, and science. During the war years, Dalí also began to experiment with new media, such as sculpture and lithography, expanding his influence beyond the canvas.</p>
            <h3>Postwar in United States (1946-48)</h3>
            <p>After World War II, from 1946 to 1948, Salvador Dalí’s time in the United States marked a period of intense experimentation and a shift in his artistic focus. He became more deeply fascinated with classical techniques and themes, moving away from the surrealism that had defined his earlier works. Dalí’s exploration of religious and scientific subjects became prominent during this period, as he incorporated elements of Renaissance art and religious symbolism into his work. His famous series of Biblical and Mythological paintings from this time, such as The Sacrament of the Last Supper (1955), showcased his return to traditional forms and his growing interest in religious themes. Dalí’s personal life also flourished during this period, as his relationship with his wife, Gala, became central to both his emotional life and his art. In 1947, he held a major solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York, marking the beginning of a more commercially successful phase in his career. Despite the growing commercialism, Dalí remained committed to pushing the boundaries of art, experimenting with techniques like stereoscopic painting and utilizing modern technology to create visual illusions. His works from this period reflect his continued exploration of the unconscious, but with an added layer of intellectual and spiritual inquiry, marking a clear departure from his early surrealist roots.</p>
            <h3>Later Years in Spain and Death</h3>
            <p>From 1948 to 1968, Salvador Dalí’s later years in Spain were marked by both artistic evolution and personal challenges. After returning to his native Catalonia in 1948, Dalí settled in the town of Port Lligat, where he lived with his wife Gala in a large, surrealist-style home. During this period, Dalí's work became more focused on classical art forms, incorporating elements of Renaissance and Baroque styles into his paintings. His obsession with optical illusions, the scientific discoveries of the time, and religious themes became central to his work. Paintings like The Ascension of Christ (1958) and The Sacrament of the Last Supper (1955) showcased his mastery of classical technique combined with surreal elements. Dalí also ventured into sculpture, jewelry design, and even stage set design, expanding his influence across different artistic media. However, his later years were also marked by personal struggles. Gala, his muse and wife, became ill, and Dalí’s own health began to decline. In 1982, after suffering a stroke and the loss of Gala in 1984, Dalí’s health deteriorated further, and he lived in relative seclusion until his death in 1989. Despite these challenges, his work continued to be celebrated, and his legacy as one of the most innovative and provocative artists of the 20th century was solidified during this time.</p>
